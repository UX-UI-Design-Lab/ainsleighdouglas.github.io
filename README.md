### DH 150: UX/UI by Ainsleigh Douglas

## Introduction
  It's important in this day in age to find ways to destress and create a sense of relaxation. Simple pleasures to often appear as alone time with your personal device in a quiet area of your home. Since technology is so embedded in our everyday lives we often find solace in a good TV show and a nice snack. It is important that streaming devices are easy to use and intuitive, but most importantly that way there is no extra stress added. If the user's cognitive load is burdened with over complicated tasks then the app/site will be doing the opposite of its given purpose.

## Design Statement
  This prototype was designed keeping in mind middle aged women and what would assist in their interaction with the website. I kept in mind average technology experience/knowledge, accessibility of visuals and low cognitive stress. During the user's experience they should have the ability to navigate the site to any extent they want, from searching a specific genre to being directed to a specific show.

## Competitor analysis
  Usability testing of a streaming device is critical to ensure that tasks are intuitive, even when trying to include a variety of information on said app. UT helps the designer better understand the level of knowledge/relationship a specific audience has with an interface. In my research, streaming platforms come in a wide variety of options, some are easier to use than others. From past experience, Hulu is deemed one of the least intuitive platforms, however it has one of the most abundant selections. Different age groups and demographics have varying experience using streaming platforms and things that should seem obvious may not be. A mid-aged woman may want to complete a certain task that is difficult to do on Hulu, which affects her overall experience and happiness rating.

  Hulu is a streaming platform that provides a variety of shows, movies and Live television to its users. Hulu is customizable, kid friendly and requires a subscription. Overall Hulu provides a lot of great shows and has a great aesthetic, but I have had multiple issues with the platform not working on my app or my desktop and has left me discouraged from using it. 9Anime is a streaming service that provides a multitude of anime shows and movies. This platform is unsanctioned which leads to many hiccups, however it functions well and provides the users with basic necessities.
