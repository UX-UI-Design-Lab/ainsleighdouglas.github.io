### DH 150: UX/UI by Ainsleigh Douglas

## Introduction
  It's important in this day in age to find ways to destress and create a sense of relaxation. Simple pleasures to often appear as alone time with your personal device in a quiet area of your home. Since technology is so embedded in our everyday lives we often find solace in a good TV show and a nice snack. It is important that streaming devices are easy to use and intuitive, but most importantly that way there is no extra stress added. If the user's cognitive load is burdened with over complicated tasks then the app/site will be doing the opposite of its given purpose.

## Design Statement
  This prototype was designed keeping in mind middle aged women and what would assist in their interaction with the website. I kept in mind average technology experience/knowledge, accessibility of visuals and low cognitive stress. During the user's experience they should have the ability to navigate the site to any extent they want, from searching a specific genre to being directed to a specific show.

1. Personalize home screen in settings
- This is a new feature I designed keeping in mind customizability and preference when using a streaming platform. The user should be able to manipulate and customize their home screen to their preferences. Ex// the user wants “suggested shows” to be at the top of the home page because that is what they use the most. Although setting this feature up may be out of some users comfort zone, in the long run it reduces cognitive stress.

2. Use favorites in the toolbar and “share a show”
- I created a feature in which the user can share moments in movies/shows, without having to go outside of the platform to communicate.  

3. Access “your feed” through the live icon in the toolbar and start watching a show
- “Your feed” is a new way of viewing your suggested and recently watched categories in a way that allows you to preview the first 15 seconds of each show in a social media type setting. This way if you are undecided on what you like to watch this feature initiates and feeds you the show. In this case you are more likely to decide on something faster because it is right in front of you. Since this is a completely new feature and icon I created for my streaming platform and I wanted to see if the user could find and access it using the powers of deduction.

## Competitor analysis
  Usability testing of a streaming device is critical to ensure that tasks are intuitive, even when trying to include a variety of information on said app. UT helps the designer better understand the level of knowledge/relationship a specific audience has with an interface. In my research, streaming platforms come in a wide variety of options, some are easier to use than others. From past experience, Hulu is deemed one of the least intuitive platforms, however it has one of the most abundant selections. Different age groups and demographics have varying experience using streaming platforms and things that should seem obvious may not be. A mid-aged woman may want to complete a certain task that is difficult to do on Hulu, which affects her overall experience and happiness rating.

<img src="ScreenShotAnime.png"> Hulu is a streaming platform that provides a variety of shows, movies and Live television to its users. Hulu is customizable, kid friendly and requires a subscription. Overall Hulu provides a lot of great shows and has a great aesthetic, but I have had multiple issues with the platform not working on my app or my desktop and has left me discouraged from using it. |<img src="ScreenShotHulu.png"> 9Anime is a streaming service that provides a multitude of anime shows and movies. This platform is unsanctioned which leads to many hiccups, however it functions well and provides the users with basic necessities.

## User research
This project explores the decompression/relaxation needs of the user and how to reduce one's cognitive load when watching a streaming platform. Ideally by exploring the results of these experiments will lead to a smoother and effortless interaction with streaming platforms and exploring streaming platforms as a proven stress relief and unwinding mechanism. This activity touches on the user’s physiological needs, social belonging and self-actualization. Physiological needs because a rejuvenated mind is necessary to one's physical health and mental health. Social belonging because shows/movies are an avenue to social interaction as well as a deeper connection to others. Lastly, self-actualization because it is an outlet to fulfill one's desire of how to become a better version of themselves.

## UX storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to put yourself in the shoes of the user to better understand their actions. The idea is to understand how the user feels when they use the product and how that can result in negative or positive emotions.
- Customizable homepage (ability to move around the categories to what you prefer at the top, recents, suggested, genres, liked, etc)
- Transparency in what's available, search availability

## Low-fidelity prototype
The purpose of creating low fidelity prototypes is to test the flow of a website and how intuitive the interactions are. Using low fidelity prototypes for the designer is to create a flow that does not have any distracting features, that can be altered easily and gives the look and feel of a website. This prototype was designed keeping in mind middle aged women and what would assist in their interaction with the website. I kept in mind average technology experience/knowledge, accessibility of visuals and low cognitive stress. During the user's experience they should have the ability to navigate the site to any extent they want, from searching a specific genre to being directed to a specific show.

## High-fidelity prototype
At this point navigation and interaction with the site should be fairly set so now the designer has the opportunity to add flare. With high fidelity prototyping the designer can begin choosing color and type while keeping accessibility and visual compatibility in mind. I chose a dark background to create a cool ambience when one is watching a show and I added color pop to keep it fun.
